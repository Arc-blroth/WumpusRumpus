command.instructions.title=Instructions
command.instructions.text=_It was an ordinary night at the Discordapp Servers..._\nAs usual, the Wumpuses were working hard fixing things and the Quantum Hamsters were coding things.\n\nSuddenly, a loud **boom** came out of nowhere! Before the Wumpuses knew it, the server racks had begun to collapse!\nAt that rate, Discord would be offline in a matter of minutes! Someone had to stop the mess!\n\n=================================\n\n**The Game**: All Wumpuses (Players) begin by spawning on a map of the Discord Servers. Each turn, Wumpuses can navigate to a different adjacent room. In each room, there wil either be a server rack, a router, a bug, a hamster, loot, or nothing. Wumpuses can choose to try to save servers, routers, and hamsters. If saving is successful, then yay! If saving is unsuccessful, servers and racks will blow up forever :\ufeff(. If a Wumpus encounters a bug, they will be forced to try attacking it. The game lasts for 10 turns.\n**Saving Servers**: Wumpuses start out with a 50% chance of success at saving a server. Each attempt at saving a server will increase the chance of success. In addition, certain pieces of loot can also affect the chance of success.\n**Bug Battles**: Similarily to server saving, Wumpuses begin with a 40% chance of winning against a bug. This chance can go up as a Wumpus battles more, and certain pieces of loot also affect the battle chance.\n**Sabatage?**: Bugs aren't the only things you can attack. Attacking servers and routers that other players have already saved will result in pure sabatage!\n**Getting Points**: Wumpuses earn points depending on how many saved servers they have saved. Saving hamsters and defeating bugs counts for extra points!\n**The Goal**:  To repair the network of routers and servers and to earn as many points as possible!
