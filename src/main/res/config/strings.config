command.instructions.title=Instructions
command.instructions.text=_It was an ordinary night at the Discordapp Servers..._\nAs usual, the Wumpuses were working hard fixing things and the Quantum Hamsters were coding things.\n\nSuddenly, a loud **boom** came out of nowhere! Before the Wumpuses knew it, the server racks had begun to collapse!\nAt that rate, Discord would be offline in a matter of minutes! Someone had to stop the mess!\n\n=================================\n\n**The Game**: All Wumpuses (Players) begin by spawning on a map of the Discord Servers. Each turn, Wumpuses can navigate to a different adjacent room. In each room, there wil either be a server rack, a router, a bug, a hamster, loot, or nothing. Wumpuses can choose to try to save servers, routers, and hamsters. If saving is successful, then yay! If saving is unsuccessful, servers and racks will blow up forever :\ufeff(. If a Wumpus encounters a bug, they will be forced to try attacking it.\n**Saving Servers**: Wumpuses start out with a 50% chance of success at saving a server. Each attempt at saving a server will increase the chance of success. In addition, certain pieces of loot can also affect the chance of success.\n**Bug Battles**: Similarily to server saving, Wumpuses begin with a 60% chance of winning against a bug. This chance can go up as a Wumpus battles more, and certain pieces of loot also affect the battle chance.\n**The Network**: Each saved server rack is considered "connected" to any adjacent racks, and each router links up with another router. Wumpuses earn points depending on how many connected servers they have saved. Saving hamsters and defeating bugs counts for extra points!\n**The Goal**:  To repair the network of routers and servers and to earn as many points as possible!
